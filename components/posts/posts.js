                <h4>The Dreamy Factors</h4>

                <p>
                  In order to get everyone on the same page, with the right
                  incentives, we have to accomplish a few things:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Return to investors.</strong>&nbsp;Our investors
                    took a huge bet on us and they deserved to get a handsome
                    return.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Return to employees.</strong>&nbsp;Our team also
                    took a big bet on us over the years by investing their time.
                    They deserved a return as well.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Stock options.</strong>&nbsp;If we weren&rsquo;t
                    planning to sell the company, giving employees stock options
                    didn&rsquo;t make sense. We needed a new way for the team to
                    share in the success of the business.
                  </li>
                </ul>
